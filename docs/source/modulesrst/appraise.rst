Appraise
========

Appraisal stage of the Neighbourhood Algorithm as in `Sambridge 1999(II) <https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/138/3/727/578730?login=true>`_.
Based on an approximation of the objective surface created by the Direct Search stage of the NA,
the Appraisal stage resamples the approximation without needing to re-evaluate the objective function.
This is a fast and efficient way to obtain more samples from the objective surface.
